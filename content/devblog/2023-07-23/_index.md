I'm working through the process to correctly convert the motion capture data to look good on the robot, which will likely take months to get "good enough" looking.

I also recorded reference poses to start iterating on the math quickly. This is faster than having to mocap myself everytime I test a code change.

Instead of hacking something together, I stepped back and started planning "what I'd really like" in Miro for a more polished process.
