The Pixel Perf Market seems like it's going to be at the [Garden Grove MoonGoat Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/D2qqaDhqPSJf9Dv18) on 8/26 or 9/2.

Since there's indoor space and outlets, I'm committing to have something demoable (even if it's small).

On Sunday, I spiked on making a development blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/). It's actually really nice, and seems less effort than messing with WordPress or Django, and more flexible than Wix.

I'm going to timebox if I can make something rough and presentable by end-of-weekend, otherwise I'll be focusing on finalizing a demo for the market.
