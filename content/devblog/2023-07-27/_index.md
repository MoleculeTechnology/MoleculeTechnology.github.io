I'll start posting clips of my work on a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJkJj57m7gU).

It's more convenient to embed and share. It's less about maintaining an audience, and more for tracking and sharing progress over time.

I don't really have much time to blog. But if I can find an easy platform I like to embed videos/images over time with a caption, I might host a simple blog.
