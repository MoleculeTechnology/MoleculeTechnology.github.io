I'm Russell - a senior video game engineer & interaction designer. I like making cool stuff with technology.<br/>

Professionally, my software was seen in Hearthstone, X-Men: Apocalypse, Arrival, mother!, Kimmel Live, Enflux motion capture suits, and the innovative Diageo North America Collaboration Center.<br/>

I'm building out Molecule - a framework for creative experiences using webcam-based motion capture + lighting.
