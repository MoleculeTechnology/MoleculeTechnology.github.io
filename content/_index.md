# What is Molecule? #

{{< lead >}}
Since my time in the film industry, one problem I've faced is building applications that require specialized hardware.
{{< /lead >}}

In practice, many of the available hardware products aren't cut out for my own needs, nor the needs of my stakeholders.

I decided to learn hardware creation, and build the tools that I need for my own creative installations. I'm especially passionate about:

- Visuals.
- Interactivity.
- Lighting.
- Motion capture.

For now I'm building out Molecule - a framework for creative experiences that use webcam-based motion capture + lighting.<br/>

My dream is to build creative installations of the greats like [Rhizomatiks](https://rhizomatiks.com/en/).
